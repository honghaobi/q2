# Promise Exercise

There are two files in the callback directory: concat.js and copy.js. NOTE: do not change them, work in the exercise directory. As their name entail, one file copies the content of a js file and the other concatenates multiple js files together into the build directory.

Step by step, work through the exercises, use promises to remove all callbacks and destroy the pyramid of doom!

## Usage

Check out the callback directory and look at the files (do not modify, just notice the "callback hell").

Now `cd` into the exercise directory and modify each js file one at a time, following the instructions below.

Run by typing `node 00.js` in the terminal.

## Exercise

### 00

"Promisify" the functions. Using the `then` method, remove the callbacks from the functions.

### 01

Chain the promises. Close the functions and `return` a promise.

### 02

Repeat step 00 but with more promises.

### 03

Repeat step 01 chaining.

### 04

Use Promise.all() to simplify your solution for 03.
